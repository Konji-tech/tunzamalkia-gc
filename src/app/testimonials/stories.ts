      " I was 22 when I first realized how little I knew about my own body. Growing up, conversations about sex were shrouded in shame and secrecy. In my community, the idea of discussing anything remotely related to sexual health was taboo. So, like many other girls, I learned to stay quiet. I learned to carry my questions in silence, convinced that asking would only make people think less of me. But the questions kept coming. I wondered about contraception, about whether the pain I felt was normal, about how to protect myself in relationships that didn't always feel safe. I googled things in secret, trying to piece together answers from articles that never seemed to understand my experience. I felt alone, like I was navigating this huge part of my life completely in the dark. It wasnt until a friend shared her story—her own struggles, confusion, and eventual empowerment—that I realized I wasnt alone. Her openness was like a door had been unlocked for me. I started asking questions, and slowly, I began finding the answers I had been seeking for so long. I learned that my health, my body, and my well-being were nothing to be ashamed of. I learned that talking about these things didnt make me weak—it made me strong.Now, I share my story in the hope that it might help another woman, just like my friend,s story helped me. We dont have to face these challenges alone. Together, we can break the silence and support each other on our journeys to understanding, healing, and empowerment. ",
